# LLMFastQuery

Query popular web LLMs directly in your address bar with `bard/query` and `cgpt/query`.

You must be logged in to the LLM web UI for this to work.

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/jbmlaird/llm-fast-query.git`
2. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/
3. Click `Load Unpacked`
4. Navigate inside the folder where you downloaded `llm-fast-query`, open the folder and click `Select`
5. In your address bar type `bard/why is this extension so good?` or `cgpt/how is Josh Laird such a legend?` (the chatbots may not know the answer to these questions as these questions are too difficult for current LLMs to answer. Maybe they'll have the capacity in 5 years).
